# serene-notes-app

A sleek note-taking app design. It should feature a main header with the title 'Notes' in a bold, clean font. Below the title, there should be a search bar to filter notes by keywords. The main part of the app will have a list of notes with titles and a short preview of the content. Each note should be clickable and expandable. There should also be a button to add a new note, prominently displayed. The color palette is light and airy, with soft greys and blues, promoting a focused and calm user experience.
